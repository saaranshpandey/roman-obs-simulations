# Roman Space Telescope: Observation Simulation
**Ongoing Research Under Dr. Sako**

---

## 1. Overview
This repository contains **simulation notebooks** and utility script related to the **Roman Space Telescope** observation planning. The primary aim is to model different **exposure patterns** and **survey strategies** for fields of interest, taking into account operational constraints, pointing configurations, and efficiency metrics.

**Note:** This work is **ongoing**, with more complex exposure models under active development.

## 2. Current Focus
- **Mosaic & Deep Imaging Patterns**  
  - Generating and visualizing overlapping exposures across wide or deep survey footprints.
  - Evaluating coverage efficiency (e.g., repeated observations per pixel).
- **Healpy & Astropy Integration**  
  - Using HEALPix for spherical mapping and skymaps.
  - Employing Astropy for coordinate transformations, WCS handling, and general astronomy utilities.
- **Simulation Metrics**  
  - Tracking coverage area, repeated visits, and final mosaic patterns.
  - Producing coverage maps, cumulative distribution functions, and other plots for analysis.
